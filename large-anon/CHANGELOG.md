# Revision history for large-anon

## 0.3.3 -- 2025-07-19

* Support ghc 9.8 (Gabriele Sales)
* Support ghc 9.10 and ghc 9.12
* Use ghc-tcplugin-api 0.16.1
* Remove `fourmolu` tests from the test suite (they were causing CI problems);
  this affects the test suite only.

## 0.3.2 -- 2025-03-11

* Use ghc-tcplugin-api 0.14 (Chan Siu Man, #169)
* Add role annotation to `Record` (Sam Derbyshire, #167)

## 0.3.1 -- 2024-05-30

* Support ghc 9.6 (and drop ghc <= 8.8)
  [together with Gabriele Sales]

## 0.3 -- 2023-07-04

* Critical bugfix (#146): incremental record construction was fundamentally
  broken. This is a major version dump because the internal representation
  is different, so if any code happens to rely on that, it will need to be
  updated. Specifically, indices into the underlying representation of the
  record are now interpreted from the _end_ of the array, rather than the
  start; this is necessary to ensure that inserting new fields (which are
  prepended to the record row) do not affect the indices of old fields.
  With thanks to Johannes Gerer for the bug report and initial investigation.
* One somewhat unfortunate consequence of this new design is that we can no
  longer resolve constraints `HasField` constraints unless _all_ fields in the
  record are known. Previously, we had limited support for resolving `HasField`
  constraints for rows such as `(a := Int ': r)`. However, since this
  support did not extend to other constraints, it was probably not very useful
  anyway; `large-anon` is quite explicit about not supporting inductive
  reasoning.
* Add `disableFourmoluExec` flag to disable the Fourmolu tests in the test suite
  (#145; together with Johannes Gerer).

## 0.2.1 -- 2023-06-05

## 0.2 -- 2023-03-06
