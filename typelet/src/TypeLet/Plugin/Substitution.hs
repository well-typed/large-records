-- | Construct idempotent substitution

-- TODO: Not entirely sure if this is correct, might be too simplistic and/or an
-- abuse of the ghc API; it is a /whole/ lot simpler than @niFixTCvSubst@, which
-- is disconcerning. However, it seems to work for the examples so far; perhaps
-- our use case is simpler? Needs more thought.

-- | Order the assignments
--
-- Suppose we have two assignments
--
-- > x := xT
-- > y := yT    where  x in (freevars yT)
--
-- Then the substitution should map @y@ to @(x := xT) yT@. We do this by
-- constructing the substitution in order, adding assignments one by one,
-- applying them to all assignments already in the accumulated substitution
-- as we go. In this example, this means adding @y := yT@ /first/, so that
-- we can apply @x := xT@ later (note that recursive definitions are
-- impossible in our use case).
--
-- In order to find the right order, we construct a graph of assignments. To
-- continue with our example, this graph will contain an edge
--
-- > (y := yT) -----> (x := xT)
--
-- The required assignment ordering is then obtained by topological sort.
